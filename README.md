# Imbalanced_CC_Fraud_Detection

In order to run the jupyter notebook you should download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1USAO5yNCwGOK3SUfUq5KDYsry4mnitA6/view?usp=sharing "Credit Card Transaction Dataset") and place it in the same working directory.

Also worth noting the last (keras) model is already trained and gets loaded by default but the cell below the loading can be commented out if you want to train it yourself.
